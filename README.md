# Detecting-beginning-and-end-of-activities
This is a problem challenge about signal processing

## Beginning 
Run the following commands if you use script :

	 - import the function "script_IMU and tools"
    
When you use script, use csv file:

	 - test1=IMU(path+filename)
	 
path = durectory of your file

filename= name of your filewith the extension (example :"filename.csv").
  
When you use notebook, use dataframe  

	 test1=IMU(dataset)

## Imported facilities and libraries

- seaborn
- numpy.linalg
- os
- pandas
- pathlib
- numpy
- numpy.linalg
- scipy
- scipy.signal
- matplotlib.pyplot
- albumentations
- pickle
- torch.utils.data

Link of the Git : https://github.com/zak-9130/Detecting-beginning-and-end-of-activities.git 
   

After clone the github, you have to write in your terminal

	 pip install requirements.txt

I tried to reproduce the subject using Maachine learning with ARIMA which is a time series prediction model so that it can recognise redundant patterns but the dataset is very small to do this.

#### TO DO: IMPROVE THE SCRIPTS AND THE EFFICIENT AND ACCURACY OF ALGORITHM
